# <!-- rdoc-file=lib/tempfile.rb -->
# A utility class for managing temporary files.
#
# There are two kind of methods of creating a temporary file:
#
# *   Tempfile.create (recommended)
# *   Tempfile.new and Tempfile.open (mostly for backward compatibility, not
#     recommended)
#
# Tempfile.create creates a usual File object. The timing of file deletion is
# predictable. Also, it supports open-and-unlink technique which removes the
# temporary file immediately after creation.
#
# Tempfile.new and Tempfile.open creates a Tempfile object. The created file is
# removed by the GC (finalizer). The timing of file deletion is not predictable.
#
# ## Synopsis
#
#     require 'tempfile'
#
#     # Tempfile.create with a block
#     # The filename are chosen automatically.
#     # (You can specify the prefix and suffix of the filename by an optional argument.)
#     Tempfile.create {|f|
#       f.puts "foo"
#       f.rewind
#       f.read                # => "foo\n"
#     }                       # The file is removed at block exit.
#
#     # Tempfile.create without a block
#     # You need to unlink the file in non-block form.
#     f = Tempfile.create
#     f.puts "foo"
#     f.close
#     File.unlink(f.path)     # You need to unlink the file.
#
#     # Tempfile.create(anonymous: true) without a block
#     f = Tempfile.create(anonymous: true)
#     # The file is already removed because anonymous.
#     f.path                  # => "/tmp/"  (no filename since no file)
#     f.puts "foo"
#     f.rewind
#     f.read                  # => "foo\n"
#     f.close
#
#     # Tempfile.create(anonymous: true) with a block
#     Tempfile.create(anonymous: true) {|f|
#       # The file is already removed because anonymous.
#       f.path                # => "/tmp/"  (no filename since no file)
#       f.puts "foo"
#       f.rewind
#       f.read                # => "foo\n"
#     }
#
#     # Not recommended: Tempfile.new without a block
#     file = Tempfile.new('foo')
#     file.path      # => A unique filename in the OS's temp directory,
#                    #    e.g.: "/tmp/foo.24722.0"
#                    #    This filename contains 'foo' in its basename.
#     file.write("hello world")
#     file.rewind
#     file.read      # => "hello world"
#     file.close
#     file.unlink    # deletes the temp file
#
# ## About Tempfile.new and Tempfile.open
#
# This section does not apply to Tempfile.create because it returns a File
# object (not a Tempfile object).
#
# When you create a Tempfile object, it will create a temporary file with a
# unique filename. A Tempfile objects behaves just like a File object, and you
# can perform all the usual file operations on it: reading data, writing data,
# changing its permissions, etc. So although this class does not explicitly
# document all instance methods supported by File, you can in fact call any File
# instance method on a Tempfile object.
#
# A Tempfile object has a finalizer to remove the temporary file. This means
# that the temporary file is removed via GC. This can cause several problems:
#
# *   Long GC intervals and conservative GC can accumulate temporary files that
#     are not removed.
# *   Temporary files are not removed if Ruby exits abnormally (such as SIGKILL,
#     SEGV).
#
# There are legacy good practices for Tempfile.new and Tempfile.open as follows.
#
# ### Explicit close
#
# When a Tempfile object is garbage collected, or when the Ruby interpreter
# exits, its associated temporary file is automatically deleted. This means that
# it's unnecessary to explicitly delete a Tempfile after use, though it's a good
# practice to do so: not explicitly deleting unused Tempfiles can potentially
# leave behind a large number of temp files on the filesystem until they're
# garbage collected. The existence of these temp files can make it harder to
# determine a new Tempfile filename.
#
# Therefore, one should always call #unlink or close in an ensure block, like
# this:
#
#     file = Tempfile.new('foo')
#     begin
#        # ...do something with file...
#     ensure
#        file.close
#        file.unlink   # deletes the temp file
#     end
#
# Tempfile.create { ... } exists for this purpose and is more convenient to use.
# Note that Tempfile.create returns a File instance instead of a Tempfile, which
# also avoids the overhead and complications of delegation.
#
#     Tempfile.create('foo') do |file|
#        # ...do something with file...
#     end
#
# ### Unlink after creation
#
# On POSIX systems, it's possible to unlink a file right after creating it, and
# before closing it. This removes the filesystem entry without closing the file
# handle, so it ensures that only the processes that already had the file handle
# open can access the file's contents. It's strongly recommended that you do
# this if you do not want any other processes to be able to read from or write
# to the Tempfile, and you do not need to know the Tempfile's filename either.
#
# Also, this guarantees the temporary file is removed even if Ruby exits
# abnormally. The OS reclaims the storage for the temporary file when the file
# is closed or the Ruby process exits (normally or abnormally).
#
# For example, a practical use case for unlink-after-creation would be this: you
# need a large byte buffer that's too large to comfortably fit in RAM, e.g. when
# you're writing a web server and you want to buffer the client's file upload
# data.
#
# `Tempfile.create(anonymous: true)` supports this behavior. It also works on
# Windows.
#
# ## Minor notes
#
# Tempfile's filename picking method is both thread-safe and inter-process-safe:
# it guarantees that no other threads or processes will pick the same filename.
#
# Tempfile itself however may not be entirely thread-safe. If you access the
# same Tempfile object from multiple threads then you should protect it with a
# mutex.
#
class Tempfile < File
  # <!--
  #   rdoc-file=lib/tempfile.rb
  #   - create(basename="", tmpdir=nil, mode: 0, anonymous: false, **options, &block)
  # -->
  # Creates a file in the underlying file system; returns a new File object based
  # on that file.
  #
  # With no block given and no arguments, creates and returns file whose:
  #
  # *   Class is [File](rdoc-ref:File) (not Tempfile).
  # *   Directory is the system temporary directory (system-dependent).
  # *   Generated filename is unique in that directory.
  # *   Permissions are `0600`; see [File
  #     Permissions](rdoc-ref:File@File+Permissions).
  # *   Mode is `'w+'` (read/write mode, positioned at the end).
  #
  # The temporary file removal depends on the keyword argument `anonymous` and
  # whether a block is given or not. See the description about the `anonymous`
  # keyword argument later.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #     f = Tempfile.create     # => #<File:/tmp/20220505-9795-17ky6f6>
  #     f.class                 # => File
  #     f.path                  # => "/tmp/20220505-9795-17ky6f6"
  #     f.stat.mode.to_s(8)     # => "100600"
  #     f.close
  #     File.exist?(f.path)     # => true
  #     File.unlink(f.path)
  #     File.exist?(f.path)     # => false
  #
  #     Tempfile.create {|f|
  #       f.puts "foo"
  #       f.rewind
  #       f.read                # => "foo\n"
  #       f.path                # => "/tmp/20240524-380207-oma0ny"
  #       File.exist?(f.path)   # => true
  #     }                       # The file is removed at block exit.
  #
  #     f = Tempfile.create(anonymous: true)
  #     # The file is already removed because anonymous
  #     f.path                  # => "/tmp/"  (no filename since no file)
  #     f.puts "foo"
  #     f.rewind
  #     f.read                  # => "foo\n"
  #     f.close
  #
  #     Tempfile.create(anonymous: true) {|f|
  #       # The file is already removed because anonymous
  #       f.path                # => "/tmp/"  (no filename since no file)
  #       f.puts "foo"
  #       f.rewind
  #       f.read                # => "foo\n"
  #     }
  #
  # The argument `basename`, if given, may be one of the following:
  #
  # *   A string: the generated filename begins with `basename`:
  #
  #         Tempfile.create('foo') # => #<File:/tmp/foo20220505-9795-1gok8l9>
  #
  # *   An array of two strings `[prefix, suffix]`: the generated filename begins
  #     with `prefix` and ends with `suffix`:
  #
  #         Tempfile.create(%w/foo .jpg/) # => #<File:/tmp/foo20220505-17839-tnjchh.jpg>
  #
  # With arguments `basename` and `tmpdir`, the file is created in the directory
  # `tmpdir`:
  #
  #     Tempfile.create('foo', '.') # => #<File:./foo20220505-9795-1emu6g8>
  #
  # Keyword arguments `mode` and `options` are passed directly to the method
  # [File.open](rdoc-ref:File.open):
  #
  # *   The value given for `mode` must be an integer and may be expressed as the
  #     logical OR of constants defined in
  #     [File::Constants](rdoc-ref:File::Constants).
  # *   For `options`, see [Open Options](rdoc-ref:IO@Open+Options).
  #
  # The keyword argument `anonymous` specifies when the file is removed.
  #
  # *   `anonymous=false` (default) without a block: the file is not removed.
  # *   `anonymous=false` (default) with a block: the file is removed after the
  #     block exits.
  # *   `anonymous=true` without a block: the file is removed before returning.
  # *   `anonymous=true` with a block: the file is removed before the block is
  #     called.
  #
  # In the first case (`anonymous=false` without a block), the file is not removed
  # automatically. It should be explicitly closed. It can be used to rename to the
  # desired filename. If the file is not needed, it should be explicitly removed.
  #
  # The File#path method of the created file object returns the temporary
  # directory with a trailing slash when `anonymous` is true.
  #
  # When a block is given, it creates the file as described above, passes it to
  # the block, and returns the block's value. Before the returning, the file
  # object is closed and the underlying file is removed:
  #
  #     Tempfile.create {|file| file.path } # => "/tmp/20220505-9795-rkists"
  #
  # Implementation note:
  #
  # The keyword argument `anonymous=true` is implemented using `FILE_SHARE_DELETE`
  # on Windows. `O_TMPFILE` is used on Linux.

  # Please use Tempfile.create instead, which avoids the cost of delegation, does

  # Tempfile.open is still appropriate if you need the Tempfile to be unlinked by

  #
  # If no block is given, this is a synonym for Tempfile.new.
  #
  # If a block is given, then a Tempfile object will be constructed, and the block
  # is run with the Tempfile object as argument. The Tempfile object will be
  # automatically closed after the block terminates. However, the file will
  # **not** be unlinked and needs to be manually unlinked with Tempfile#close! or
  # Tempfile#unlink. The finalizer will try to unlink but should not be relied

  #
  # However, unlink-before-close may not be supported on non-POSIX operating
  # systems. Microsoft Windows is the most notable case: unlinking a non-closed
  # file will result in an error, which this method will silently ignore. If you
  # want to practice unlink-before-close whenever possible, then you should write
  # code like this:
  #
  #     file = Tempfile.new('foo')
  #     file.unlink   # On Windows this silently fails.
  #     begin
  #        # ... do something with file ...
  #     ensure
  #        file.close!   # Closes the file handle. If the file wasn't unlinked
  #                      # because #unlink failed, then this method will attempt
  #                      # to do so again.
