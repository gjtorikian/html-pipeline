    # ## ARGF and `ARGV`
    #
    # The ARGF object works with the array at global variable `ARGV` to make
    # `$stdin` and file streams available in the Ruby program:
    #
    # *   **ARGV** may be thought of as the **argument vector** array.
    #
    #     Initially, it contains the command-line arguments and options that are
    #     passed to the Ruby program; the program can modify that array as it likes.
    #
    # *   **ARGF** may be thought of as the **argument files** object.
    #
    #     It can access file streams and/or the `$stdin` stream, based on what it
    #     finds in `ARGV`. This provides a convenient way for the command line to
    #     specify streams for a Ruby program to read.
    #
    # ## Reading
    #
    # ARGF may read from *source* streams, which at any particular time are
    # determined by the content of `ARGV`.
    #
    # ### Simplest Case
    #
    # When the *very first* ARGF read occurs with an empty `ARGV` (`[]`), the source
    # is `$stdin`:
    #
    # *   File `t.rb`:
    #
    #         p ['ARGV', ARGV]
    #         p ['ARGF.read', ARGF.read]
    #
    # *   Commands and outputs (see below for the content of files `foo.txt` and
    #     `bar.txt`):
    #
    #         $ echo "Open the pod bay doors, Hal." | ruby t.rb
    #         ["ARGV", []]
    #         ["ARGF.read", "Open the pod bay doors, Hal.\n"]
    #
    #         $ cat foo.txt bar.txt | ruby t.rb
    #         ["ARGV", []]
    #         ["ARGF.read", "Foo 0\nFoo 1\nBar 0\nBar 1\nBar 2\nBar 3\n"]
    #
    # ### About the Examples
    #
    # Many examples here assume the existence of files `foo.txt` and `bar.txt`:
    #
    #     $ cat foo.txt
    #     Foo 0
    #     Foo 1
    #     $ cat bar.txt
    #     Bar 0
    #     Bar 1
    #     Bar 2
    #     Bar 3
    #
    # ### Sources in `ARGV`
    #
    # For any ARGF read *except* the [simplest case](rdoc-ref:ARGF@Simplest+Case)
    # (that is, *except* for the *very first* ARGF read with an empty `ARGV`), the
    # sources are found in `ARGV`.
    #
    # ARGF assumes that each element in array `ARGV` is a potential source, and is
    # one of:
    #
    # *   The string path to a file that may be opened as a stream.
    # *   The character `'-'`, meaning stream `$stdin`.
    #
    # Each element that is *not* one of these should be removed from `ARGV` before
    # ARGF accesses that source.
    #
    # In the following example:
    #
    # *   Filepaths `foo.txt` and `bar.txt` may be retained as potential sources.
    # *   Options `--xyzzy` and `--mojo` should be removed.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    # *   File `t.rb`:
    #
    #         # Print arguments (and options, if any) found on command line.
    #         p ['ARGV', ARGV]
    #
    # *   Command and output:
    #
    #         $ ruby t.rb --xyzzy --mojo foo.txt bar.txt
    #         ["ARGV", ["--xyzzy", "--mojo", "foo.txt", "bar.txt"]]
    #
    # ARGF's stream access considers the elements of `ARGV`, left to right:
    #
    # *   File `t.rb`:
    #
    #         p "ARGV: #{ARGV}"
    #         p "Read: #{ARGF.read}" # Read everything from all specified streams.
    #
    # *   Command and output:
    #
    #         $ ruby t.rb foo.txt bar.txt
    #         "ARGV: [\"foo.txt\", \"bar.txt\"]"
    #         "Read: Foo 0\nFoo 1\nBar 0\nBar 1\nBar 2\nBar 3\n"
    #
    # Because the value at `ARGV` is an ordinary array, you can manipulate it to
    # control which sources ARGF considers:
    #
    # *   If you remove an element from `ARGV`, ARGF will not consider the
    #     corresponding source.
    # *   If you add an element to `ARGV`, ARGF will consider the corresponding
    #     source.
    #
    # Each element in `ARGV` is removed when its corresponding source is accessed;
    # when all sources have been accessed, the array is empty:
    #
    # *   File `t.rb`:
    #
    #         until ARGV.empty? && ARGF.eof?
    #           p "ARGV: #{ARGV}"
    #           p "Line: #{ARGF.readline}" # Read each line from each specified stream.
    #         end
    #
    # *   Command and output:
    #
    #         $ ruby t.rb foo.txt bar.txt
    #         "ARGV: [\"foo.txt\", \"bar.txt\"]"
    #         "Line: Foo 0\n"
    #         "ARGV: [\"bar.txt\"]"
    #         "Line: Foo 1\n"
    #         "ARGV: [\"bar.txt\"]"
    #         "Line: Bar 0\n"
    #         "ARGV: []"
    #         "Line: Bar 1\n"
    #         "ARGV: []"
    #         "Line: Bar 2\n"
    #         "ARGV: []"
    #         "Line: Bar 3\n"
    #
    # #### Filepaths in `ARGV`
    #
    # The `ARGV` array may contain filepaths the specify sources for ARGF reading.
    #
    # This program prints what it reads from files at the paths specified on the
    # command line:
    #
    # *   File `t.rb`:
    #
    #         p ['ARGV', ARGV]
    #         # Read and print all content from the specified sources.
    #         p ['ARGF.read', ARGF.read]
    #
    # *   Command and output:
    #
    #         $ ruby t.rb foo.txt bar.txt
    #         ["ARGV", [foo.txt, bar.txt]
    #         ["ARGF.read", "Foo 0\nFoo 1\nBar 0\nBar 1\nBar 2\nBar 3\n"]
    #
    # #### Specifying `$stdin` in `ARGV`
    #
    # To specify stream `$stdin` in `ARGV`, us the character `'-'`:
    #
    # *   File `t.rb`:
    #
    #         p ['ARGV', ARGV]
    #         p ['ARGF.read', ARGF.read]
    #
    # *   Command and output:
    #
    #         $ echo "Open the pod bay doors, Hal." | ruby t.rb -
    #         ["ARGV", ["-"]]
    #         ["ARGF.read", "Open the pod bay doors, Hal.\n"]
    #
    # When no character `'-'` is given, stream `$stdin` is ignored (exception: see
    # [Specifying $stdin in ARGV](rdoc-ref:ARGF@Specifying+-24stdin+in+ARGV)):
    #
    # *   Command and output:
    #
    #         $ echo "Open the pod bay doors, Hal." | ruby t.rb foo.txt bar.txt
    #         "ARGV: [\"foo.txt\", \"bar.txt\"]"
    #         "Read: Foo 0\nFoo 1\nBar 0\nBar 1\nBar 2\nBar 3\n"
    #
    # #### Mixtures and Repetitions in `ARGV`
    #
    # For an ARGF reader, `ARGV` may contain any mixture of filepaths and character
    # `'-'`, including repetitions.
    #
    # #### Modifications to `ARGV`
    #
    # The running Ruby program may make any modifications to the `ARGV` array; the
    # current value of `ARGV` affects ARGF reading.
    #
    # #### Empty `ARGV`
    #
    # For an empty `ARGV`, an ARGF read method either returns `nil` or raises an
    # exception, depending on the specific method.
    #
    # ### More Read Methods
    #
    # As seen above, method ARGF#read reads the content of all sources into a single
    # string. Other ARGF methods provide other ways to access that content; these
    # include:
    #
    # *   Byte access: #each_byte, #getbyte, #readbyte.
    # *   Character access: #each_char, #getc, #readchar.
    # *   Codepoint access: #each_codepoint.
    # *   Line access: #each_line, #gets, #readline, #readlines.
    # *   Source access: #read, #read_nonblock, #readpartial.
    #
    # ### About Enumerable
    #
    # ARGF includes module Enumerable. Virtually all methods in Enumerable call
    # method `#each` in the including class.
    #
    # **Note well**: In ARGF, method #each returns data from the *sources*, *not*
    # from `ARGV`; therefore, for example, `ARGF#entries` returns an array of lines
    # from the sources, not an array of the strings from `ARGV`:
    #
    # *   File `t.rb`:
    #
    #         p ['ARGV', ARGV]
    #         p ['ARGF.entries', ARGF.entries]
    #
    # *   Command and output:
    #
    #         $ ruby t.rb foo.txt bar.txt
    #         ["ARGV", ["foo.txt", "bar.txt"]]
    #         ["ARGF.entries", ["Foo 0\n", "Foo 1\n", "Bar 0\n", "Bar 1\n", "Bar 2\n", "Bar 3\n"]]
    #
    # ## Writing
    #
    # If *inplace mode* is in effect, ARGF may write to target streams, which at any
    # particular time are determined by the content of ARGV.
    #
    # Methods about inplace mode:
    #
    # *   #inplace_mode
    # *   #inplace_mode=
    # *   #to_write_io
    #
    # Methods for writing:
    #
    # *   #print
    # *   #printf
    # *   #putc
    # *   #puts
    # *   #write
