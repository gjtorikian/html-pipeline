== DESCRIPTION:

PathExpander helps pre-process command-line arguments expanding
directories into their constituent files. It further helps by
providing additional mechanisms to make specifying subsets easier
with path subtraction and allowing for command-line arguments to be
saved in a file.

NOTE: this is NOT an options processor. It is a path processor
(basically everything else besides options). It does provide a
mechanism for pre-filtering cmdline options, but not with the intent
of actually processing them in PathExpander. Use OptionParser to
deal with options either before or after passing ARGV through
PathExpander.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Processes command-line arguments.
* Expands directories into files using custom globs.
* Allows for negation of files.
* Allows for use of files as persisted args.
* Provides a .ignore mechanism for lightweight persistent exclusion.

== SYNOPSIS:

    class MyPathExpander < PathExpander
      MY_GLOB = "**/*.rb"

      def initialize args = ARGV
        super args, MY_GLOB
      end
    end

    MyPathExpander.new(ARGV, my_glob).process do |f|
      # do something with each file
    end

== REQUIREMENTS:

* ruby

== INSTALL:

* gem install path_expander
