    # This class is responsible for storing and looking up information related to generic types.
    #
    # The class stores 2 different kinds of data, in two separate lookup tables:
    #   1. a lookup of generic type instances by name: `@generic_instances`
    #   2. a lookup of type variable serializer by constant and type variable
    #      instance: `@type_variables`
    #
    # By storing the above data, we can cheaply query each constant against this registry
    # to see if it declares any generic type variables. This becomes a simple lookup in the
    # `@type_variables` hash table with the given constant.
    #
    # If there is no entry, then we can cheaply know that we can skip generic type
    # information generation for this type.
    #
    # On the other hand, if we get a result, then the result will be a hash of type
    # variable to type variable serializers. This allows us to associate type variables
    # to the constant names that represent them, easily.
