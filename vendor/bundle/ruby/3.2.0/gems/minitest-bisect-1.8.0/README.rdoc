== DESCRIPTION:

Hunting down random test failures can be very very difficult,
sometimes impossible, but minitest-bisect makes it easy.

minitest-bisect helps you isolate and debug random test failures.

If your tests only fail randomly, you can reproduce the error
consistently by using `--seed <num>`, but what then? How do you figure
out which combination of tests out of hundreds are responsible for the
failure? You know which test is failing, but what others are causing
it to fail or were helping it succeed in a different order? That's
what minitest-bisect does best.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* normal mode: runs your tests with a fixed seed and minimizes the
  tests to find a minimal set to reproduce the failure.
* inverted mode: runs your tests with a fixed seed and a starting
  failure and minimizes the tests to find a minimal set to reproduce
  the false positive.
* Includes Enumerable#find_minimal_combination and
  #find_minimal_combination_and_count.

== SYNOPSIS:

Let's say you have a bunch of test files and they fail sometimes, but
not consistently. You get a run that fails, so you record the
randomization seed that minitest displays at the top of every run.

=== Normally, it passes:

  % minitest example
  Run options: --seed 42

  800 runs, 798 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips

=== Original Failure:

But someone sees the failure either locally or on the CI. They record
the output and get the randomization seed that causes the test
ordering bug:

  $ minitest example --seed 314
  Run options: --seed 314

  TestBad4#test_bad4_4 [example/helper.rb:16]:
  muahahaha order dependency bug!

  800 runs, 799 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips

=== Minimization and Isolation:

The problem is about how to efficiently figure out the minimal
reproduction of the random failure so you can actually focus on the
problem and not all the noise.

So, you run the tests again, but this time with minitest_bisect.
Provide the seed given in the failure so the tests always run in the
same order and reproduce every time.

minitest_bisect will minimize the number of methods.

    1) Failure:
  TestBad4#test_bad4_4 [/Users/ryan/Work/p4/zss/src/minitest-bisect/dev/example/helper.rb:16]:
  muahahaha order dependency bug!

Voila! This reduced it from 800 tests across 8 files down to 2 tests
across 2 files. Note how we went from a ~200 second test run to a ~0.5
second test run. Debugging that will be 400x faster and that much
easier.

=== What Now?

Now, it is now up to you to look at the source of both of those tests
to determine what side-effects (or lack thereof) are causing your test
failure when run in this specific order.

This happens in a single run. Depending on how many files / tests you
have and how long they take, the minimization might take a long time,
but each iteration can reduce the number of tests so it should get
quicker with time.

=== But sometimes, it fails:

Sometimes a test fails by itself consistently but passes most of the
time in CI. This is a false-positive in that the test SHOULD be
failing all the time but some other test is causing a side-effect that
it making it pass. This is sometimes harder to track down and reason
about. minitest-bisect now has an "inverted" mode, where you run as
normal but point it at a failing test by name. It will then validate
that the test fails by itself but passes when run in full with the
given seed. Then it tries to isolate and answer "what is the minimal
combination of tests to run to # make this test pass?". For example:

  % minitest_bisect example --seed=3 -n="/failing_test_name_regexp/"

== REQUIREMENTS:

* minitest 5+

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install minitest-bisect

== FAQ:

==== Q: What if my tests are in multiple subdirectories (e.g. 'test/' folder in a Rails app)?

This is assuming the following doesn't work for you:

  minitest_bisect --seed 3911 -Itest test/*_test.rb

because you need it to span multiple sub-directories.

A: Use your shell to find the files for you

  minitest_bisect --seed 3911 -Itest $(find test -type f -name \*_test.rb)

or

  minitest_bisect --seed 3911 test/**/*_test.rb

==== Q: How do I resolve an "invalid option: \--server" error?
  $ MTB_VERBOSE=2 minitest_bisect --seed 3911 example/test*.rb
  reproducing...
  ruby -Ilib -e 'require "./example/test_bad1.rb" ; require "./example/test_bad4.rb"' -- --seed 3911 --server 33352

  invalid option: --server

  minitest options:
      -h, --help                       Display this help.
      -s, --seed SEED                  Sets random seed. Also via env. Eg: SEED=n rake
      -v, --verbose                    Verbose. Show progress processing files.
      -n, --name PATTERN               Filter run on /regexp/ or string.

  Known extensions: guard_minitest, pride
      -p, --pride                      Pride. Show your testing pride!
  Reproduction run passed? Aborting. Try running with MTB_VERBOSE=2 to verify.

A: Try adding "<tt>gem minitest-bisect</tt>" to your Gemfile and running "<tt>bundle install</tt>"
