# An Array object is an ordered, integer-indexed collection of objects, called
# *elements*; the object represents an [array data
# structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_structure)).
#
# An element may be any object (even another array); elements may be any mixture
# of objects of different types.
#
# Important data structures that use arrays include:
#
# *   [Coordinate vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_vector).
# *   [Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)).
# *   [Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)).
# *   [Hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table).
# *   [Deque (double-ended
#     queue)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue).
# *   [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)).
# *   [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)).
#
# There are also array-like data structures:
#
# *   [Associative array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) (see
#     Hash).
# *   [Directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)) (see
#     Dir).
# *   [Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) (see
#     ENV).
# *   [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)) (see Set).
# *   [String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) (see
#     String).
#
# ## Array Indexes
#
# Array indexing starts at 0, as in C or Java.
#
# A non-negative index is an offset from the first element:
#
# *   Index 0 indicates the first element.
# *   Index 1 indicates the second element.
# *   ...
#
# A negative index is an offset, backwards, from the end of the array:
#
# *   Index -1 indicates the last element.
# *   Index -2 indicates the next-to-last element.
# *   ...
#
# ### In-Range and Out-of-Range Indexes
#
# A non-negative index is *in range* if and only if it is smaller than the size
# of the array.  For a 3-element array:
#
# *   Indexes 0 through 2 are in range.
# *   Index 3 is out of range.
#
# A negative index is *in range* if and only if its absolute value is not larger
# than the size of the array.  For a 3-element array:
#
# *   Indexes -1 through -3 are in range.
# *   Index -4 is out of range.
#
# ### Effective Index
#
# Although the effective index into an array is always an integer, some methods
# (both within class Array and elsewhere) accept one or more non-integer
# arguments that are [integer-convertible
# objects](rdoc-ref:implicit_conversion.rdoc@Integer-Convertible+Objects).
#
# ## Creating Arrays
#
# You can create an Array object explicitly with:
#
# *   An [array literal](rdoc-ref:syntax/literals.rdoc@Array+Literals):
#
#         [1, 'one', :one, [2, 'two', :two]]
#
# *   A [%w or %W string-array
#     Literal](rdoc-ref:syntax/literals.rdoc@25w+and+-25W-3A+String-Array+Litera
#     ls):
#
#         %w[foo bar baz] # => ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
#         %w[1 % *]       # => ["1", "%", "*"]
#
# *   A [%i or %I symbol-array
#     Literal](rdoc-ref:syntax/literals.rdoc@25i+and+-25I-3A+Symbol-Array+Litera
#     ls):
#
#         %i[foo bar baz] # => [:foo, :bar, :baz]
#         %i[1 % *]       # => [:"1", :%, :*]
#
# *   Method Kernel#Array:
#
#         Array(["a", "b"])             # => ["a", "b"]
#         Array(1..5)                   # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#         Array(key: :value)            # => [[:key, :value]]
#         Array(nil)                    # => []
#         Array(1)                      # => [1]
#         Array({:a => "a", :b => "b"}) # => [[:a, "a"], [:b, "b"]]
#
# *   Method Array.new:
#
#         Array.new               # => []
#         Array.new(3)            # => [nil, nil, nil]
#         Array.new(4) {Hash.new} # => [{}, {}, {}, {}]
#         Array.new(3, true)      # => [true, true, true]
#
#     Note that the last example above populates the array with references to
#     the same object. This is recommended only in cases where that object is a
#     natively immutable object such as a symbol, a numeric, `nil`, `true`, or
#     `false`.
#
#     Another way to create an array with various objects, using a block; this
#     usage is safe for mutable objects such as hashes, strings or other arrays:
#
#         Array.new(4) {|i| i.to_s } # => ["0", "1", "2", "3"]
#
#     Here is a way to create a multi-dimensional array:
#
#         Array.new(3) {Array.new(3)}
#         # => [[nil, nil, nil], [nil, nil, nil], [nil, nil, nil]]
#
# A number of Ruby methods, both in the core and in the standard library,
# provide instance method `to_a`, which converts an object to an array.

#
# ## Example Usage
#
# In addition to the methods it mixes in through the Enumerable module, class
# Array has proprietary methods for accessing, searching and otherwise
# manipulating arrays.
#
# Some of the more common ones are illustrated below.
#
# ## Accessing Elements
#
# Elements in an array can be retrieved using the Array#[] method.  It can take
# a single integer argument (a numeric index), a pair of arguments (start and
# length) or a range. Negative indices start counting from the end, with -1
# being the last element.
#
#     arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#     arr[2]    #=> 3
#     arr[100]  #=> nil
#     arr[-3]   #=> 4
#     arr[2, 3] #=> [3, 4, 5]
#     arr[1..4] #=> [2, 3, 4, 5]
#     arr[1..-3] #=> [2, 3, 4]
#
# Another way to access a particular array element is by using the #at method
#
#     arr.at(0) #=> 1
#
# The #slice method works in an identical manner to Array#[].
#
# To raise an error for indices outside of the array bounds or else to provide a
# default value when that happens, you can use #fetch.
#
#     arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
#     arr.fetch(100) #=> IndexError: index 100 outside of array bounds: -6...6
#     arr.fetch(100, "oops") #=> "oops"
#
# The special methods #first and #last will return the first and last elements
# of an array, respectively.
#
#     arr.first #=> 1
#     arr.last  #=> 6
#
# To return the first `n` elements of an array, use #take
#
#     arr.take(3) #=> [1, 2, 3]
#
# #drop does the opposite of #take, by returning the elements after `n` elements
# have been dropped:
#
#     arr.drop(3) #=> [4, 5, 6]
#
# ## Obtaining Information about an Array
#
# An array keeps track of its own length at all times.  To query an array about
# the number of elements it contains, use #length, #count or #size.
#
#     browsers = ['Chrome', 'Firefox', 'Safari', 'Opera', 'IE']
#     browsers.length #=> 5
#     browsers.count #=> 5
#
# To check whether an array contains any elements at all
#
#     browsers.empty? #=> false
#
# To check whether a particular item is included in the array
#
#     browsers.include?('Konqueror') #=> false
#
# ## Adding Items to an Array
#
# Items can be added to the end of an array by using either #push or #<<
#
#     arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
#     arr.push(5) #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#     arr << 6    #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#
# #unshift will add a new item to the beginning of an array.
#
#     arr.unshift(0) #=> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#
# With #insert you can add a new element to an array at any position.
#
#     arr.insert(3, 'apple')  #=> [0, 1, 2, 'apple', 3, 4, 5, 6]
#
# Using the #insert method, you can also insert multiple values at once:
#
#     arr.insert(3, 'orange', 'pear', 'grapefruit')
#     #=> [0, 1, 2, "orange", "pear", "grapefruit", "apple", 3, 4, 5, 6]
#
# ## Removing Items from an Array
#
# The method #pop removes the last element in an array and returns it:
#
#     arr =  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#     arr.pop #=> 6
#     arr #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#
# To retrieve and at the same time remove the first item, use #shift:
#
#     arr.shift #=> 1
#     arr #=> [2, 3, 4, 5]
#
# To delete an element at a particular index:
#
#     arr.delete_at(2) #=> 4
#     arr #=> [2, 3, 5]
#
# To delete a particular element anywhere in an array, use #delete:
#
#     arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]
#     arr.delete(2) #=> 2
#     arr #=> [1,3]
#
# A useful method if you need to remove `nil` values from an array is #compact:
#
#     arr = ['foo', 0, nil, 'bar', 7, 'baz', nil]
#     arr.compact  #=> ['foo', 0, 'bar', 7, 'baz']
#     arr          #=> ['foo', 0, nil, 'bar', 7, 'baz', nil]
#     arr.compact! #=> ['foo', 0, 'bar', 7, 'baz']
#     arr          #=> ['foo', 0, 'bar', 7, 'baz']
#
# Another common need is to remove duplicate elements from an array.
#
# It has the non-destructive #uniq, and destructive method #uniq!
#
#     arr = [2, 5, 6, 556, 6, 6, 8, 9, 0, 123, 556]
#     arr.uniq #=> [2, 5, 6, 556, 8, 9, 0, 123]
#
# ## Iterating over an Array
#
# Like all classes that include the Enumerable module, class Array has an each
# method, which defines what elements should be iterated over and how.  In case
# of Array#each, all elements in `self` are yielded to the supplied block in
# sequence.
#
# Note that this operation leaves the array unchanged.
#
#     arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#     arr.each {|a| print a -= 10, " "}
#     # prints: -9 -8 -7 -6 -5
#     #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#
# Another sometimes useful iterator is #reverse_each which will iterate over the
# elements in the array in reverse order.
#
#     words = %w[first second third fourth fifth sixth]
#     str = ""
#     words.reverse_each {|word| str += "#{word} "}
#     p str #=> "sixth fifth fourth third second first "
#
# The #map method can be used to create a new array based on the original array,
# but with the values modified by the supplied block:
#
#     arr.map {|a| 2*a}     #=> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
#     arr                   #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#     arr.map! {|a| a**2}   #=> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
#     arr                   #=> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
#
# ## Selecting Items from an Array
#
# Elements can be selected from an array according to criteria defined in a
# block.  The selection can happen in a destructive or a non-destructive manner.
#  While the destructive operations will modify the array they were called on,
# the non-destructive methods usually return a new array with the selected
# elements, but leave the original array unchanged.
#
# ### Non-destructive Selection
#
#     arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#     arr.select {|a| a > 3}       #=> [4, 5, 6]
#     arr.reject {|a| a < 3}       #=> [3, 4, 5, 6]
#     arr.drop_while {|a| a < 4}   #=> [4, 5, 6]
#     arr                          #=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#
# ### Destructive Selection
#
# #select! and #reject! are the corresponding destructive methods to #select and
# #reject
#
# Similar to #select vs. #reject, #delete_if and #keep_if have the exact
# opposite result when supplied with the same block:
#
#     arr.delete_if {|a| a < 4}   #=> [4, 5, 6]
#     arr                         #=> [4, 5, 6]
#
#     arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#     arr.keep_if {|a| a < 4}   #=> [1, 2, 3]
#     arr                       #=> [1, 2, 3]
#
# ## What's Here
#
# First, what's elsewhere. Class Array:
#
# *   Inherits from [class Object](rdoc-ref:Object@What-27s+Here).
